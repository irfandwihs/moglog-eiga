When I Get Home, My Wife Always Pretends to Be Dead. Original title: Ie ni kaeru
to tsuma ga kanarazu shinda furi o shite imasu. Confronted by the eccentric and
odd behaviour of his wife and the stunts she regularly pulled like ingesting
ketchup, spewing it back out and lying on the floor when her husband arrives
home from work a man posted questions to members on Yahoo Answers, which in turn
became the basis for the story of the married couple.
