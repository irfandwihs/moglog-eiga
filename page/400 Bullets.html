400 BULLETS is an edge-of-your-seat Military Action story about what it means to
fight for honor instead of profit. The film packs gun battles, epic hand-to-hand
fight sequences and witty dialogue into its 90 minute run time. A group of
mercenaries intercept and acquire four missiles on a cold, snowy night in
Afghanistan. Double-crossed, Black Ops specialist Noah Brandt escapes with the
navigation pins. On the run and injured, he stumbles upon a British outpost of
shipping containers and netting. The unit that occupies the outpost is out on a
mission, with only two soldiers and 400 bullets left to defend the compound.
