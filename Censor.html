After viewing a strangely familiar video nasty, Enid, a film censor, sets out to
solve the past mystery of her sister's disappearance, embarking on a quest that
dissolves the line between fiction and reality. In 1985, Enid Baines works for
the British Board of Film Classification during the height of the Video Nasty
controversy. Enid's co-workers call her "Little Miss Perfect" due to her
strictness in recommending that violent content be cut or banned. While Enid is
having dinner with her parents, they discuss the disappearance of Enid's sister
Nina when the two were little. Enid's parents have since declared Nina legally
dead, but Enid is convinced that her sister is still missing.
