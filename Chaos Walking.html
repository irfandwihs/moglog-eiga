Two unlikely companions embark on a perilous adventure through the badlands of
an unexplored planet as they try to escape a dangerous and disorienting reality
where all thoughts are seen and heard by everyone. In the not-too-distant
future, Todd Hewitt (Tom Holland) discovers Viola (Daisy Ridley), a mysterious
girl who crash lands on his planet, where all the women have disappeared and the
men are afflicted by "the Noise" - a force that puts all their thoughts on
display. In this dangerous landscape, Viola's life is threatened - and as Todd
vows to protect her, he will have to discover his own inner power and unlock the
planet's dark secrets. From the director of The Bourne Identity and Edge of
Tomorrow and based on the best-selling novel The Knife of Never Letting Go,
Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland star with Mads Mikkelsen, Demi√°n Bichir, Cynthia
Erivo, Nick Jonas, Kurt Sutter, and David Oyelowo in Chaos Walking. In
Prentisstown, Todd has been brought up to believe that the Spackle released a
germ that killed all the women and unleashed Noise on the remaining men. After
discovering a patch of silence out in the swamp, his surrogate parents
immediately tell him that he has to run, leaving him with only a map of New
World, a message, and many unanswered questions. He soon discovers the source of
the silence: a girl, named Viola.
