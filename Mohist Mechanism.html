the Infinity Prison to save his wife Jiang Ren, a captive in the Fort of
Mechanism. To win the bet, Shen Tuo, along with six teammates, has to go deep

complicated mechanisms are installed in the Fort, with deadly traps on every
corner. It is said that no one has ever walked out of there alive. Shen Tuo and
his team are now embarking on an epic and life-and-death adventure.
