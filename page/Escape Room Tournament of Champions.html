Six people unwillingly find themselves locked in another series of escape rooms,
slowly uncovering what they have in common to survive. Joining forces with two
of the original survivors, they soon discover they've all played the game
before. After escaping death by the skin of their teeth and surviving the bloody
games devised by the nefarious Minos Corporation, lucky players Zoey and Ben are
now coping with trauma after the events of Escape Room (2019). But instead of
finding answers and closure, Zoey and Ben are soon dragged into another set of
fiendishly designed death traps. And as a handful of former escapees join in,
the competitors must work together to outsmart their inhuman tormentors and give
their all to solve increasingly sophisticated puzzles. This time, the unseen
perils are more elaborate, and escape is futile. Who shall live and who shall
die in the sadistic Tournament of Champions?
